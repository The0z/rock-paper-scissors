    -Returns the computersChoice in String form of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    -Uses a random number generator to create a integer number of 1,2, or 3.
    -Number will be used with a helper function to convert number to Rock,
    Paper, or Scissors.

Function game
    -calls playRound inside.
    -Plays 5 rounds total (while or for loop) - I am assuming tied rounds extend game. 
        - I.e. 6 rounds due to ties.
    -Needs to also call getComputerChoice and getPlayerChoice so that playRound can function.

    requests a prompt from the user
    converts input to capitalized version to so it can be used properly by compareChoices
