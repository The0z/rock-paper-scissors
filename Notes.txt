Function playRound

    uses a helper function compareChoices that compares the choices and returns who won
    returns who has won as a string (or number that can be looked up in a dictionary - object)

Function game
    is called to begin the game
    calls playRound each time a round is played
    in this iteration will play a best out of 5 game
    iteration must keep track of best out of 5, therefore if the computer or players score is
    equal to 3 end the game and announce who won. While loop is better here. 
    game will keep track of the computer and players score using two counters.
    will return a string on who won (in the future), for now will output results to console.log

Helper Functions:

    requests a prompt from the user
    converts input to capitalized version to so it can be used properly by compareChoices
